# [VaneMart](http://laravel.ru/vanemart)

VaneMart is a free opensource e-commerce software. designed as a [Laravel](http://laravel.com) bundle.

It's depends on [Plarx](https://github.com/ProgerXP/Plarx) (Laravel extension), [Squall](https://github.com/ProgerXP/Squall) (functional PHP programming), [HTMLki](http://htmlki.com) (HTML 5 templating) and [MiMeil](https://github.com/ProgerXP/MiMeil) (e-mail dispatcher).

Currently it's in very early alpha stage and while it's being used in my commercial projects it might not be ready for public yet.
